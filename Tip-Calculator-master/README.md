# Tip-Calculator
A simple tip calculator app for Android.

It uses an EditText to enter the amount of the bill and calculates the tip by using a SeekBar maxed up to 30%
The tip is shown in TextView and shows the percentage that is being calculated.

This app is actually taught in the book "Android 6 for Programmers" by Deitel, Paul J.
